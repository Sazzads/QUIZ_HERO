        3. what is event loop and how is it work?
    </h5>
    <div class="border-2 border-black p-2">

        <p> <span class="font-bold">Event-Loop:</span> The concurrency paradigm of JavaScript, which enables the
            language to handle numerous activities concurrently
            without obstructing the execution of other processes, is fundamentally based on the event loop.

        </p>
        <p>
            An ongoing process known as the event loop in JavaScript listens for events like user input, network
            requests,
            and timer events and processes them in the order they are received. An event is added to the "task queue"
            when
            it takes place. The task queue is continually checked by the event loop for any pending tasks, which are
            then
            carried out one by one in the order they were received.
        </p>
        <p><span class="font-bold">Work Process:</span></p>
        <ul class="list-outside ...">
            <li>1. The primary thread of execution begins running the code and synchronously carrying out each function
                one at a time. Functions are added to the call stack as they are invoked.</li>
            <li>2. The related callback function is registered with the event loop and added to a task queue whenever an
                asynchronous event takes place, such as a user pushing a button, a network request concluding, or a
                timer ending. The event loop waits until the call stack is empty before executing the callback function.
            </li>
            <li>3. The task queue is continually checked by the event loop for unfinished work. The event loop pulls the
                first job from the task queue and pushes its callback function onto the call stack, where it is
                performed, when the call stack is empty.</li>
            <li>4. The event loop keeps processing asynchronous tasks as they are added to the task queue one at a time,
                always waiting for the call stack to be empty before moving on to the next job.</li>
            <li>5. The event loop keeps checking the task queue for new tasks after a function has completed running by
                removing it from the call stack.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The event loop allows JavaScript to handle asynchronous activities effectively by continually monitoring a
            task queue for outstanding jobs and executing their associated callback functions in a non-blocking,
            single-threaded manner.</p>

        4. quizTimer Function & chooseQuiz Function work
    </h5>
    <div class="border-2 border-black my-4 p-2">
        <ul><span class="font-bold">quizTimer Function: </span>
            <li class="my-1">This code establishes the "quizTimer" function, which accepts the "dismiss" option. The
                method changes
                the timer shown on the HTML page and sets an interval that runs every 1000 milliseconds (1 second).
            </li>

            <li class="my-1">
                The timer's minutes and seconds are calculated by the code within the interval, which also updates the
                HTML element with the current timer value and changes the color of the displayed text depending on
                whether the timer has reached or beyond 60 seconds.
            </li>
            <li class="my-1">
                The function clears the interval and ends the timer if the "dismiss" option is given as true. When the
                timer is no longer required, you may use this to turn it off.
            </li>

        </ul>
        <p><span class="font-bold">chooseQuiz Function: </span>
        <ul>
            <li class="my-1"> The aim of this code is to define the "chooseQuiz"function, which has two inputs: "index"
                and
                "givenAns".The "answers" array, which contains answers to individual quiz questions, is updated or added
                to by the
                function.</li>
            <li class="my-1">
                The find method is used to first determine whether the quiz question has previously been answered in the
                "answers" array. If it is present, the function finds its index in the "answers" array and modifies the
                provided answer for that quiz question by substituting a new object with the modified "givenAns"
                attribute.
            </li>
            <li class="my-1">
                The code appends a new object containing the quiz question and the provided response to the end of the
                "answers" array if the quiz question does not already exist in the "answers" array.
            </li>
            <li class="my-1"> The modified "answers" array is sent as an input to another method called
                "displayAnswers," which
                displays the answers for the user.</li>
